# zeronet-conservancy

zeronet-conservancy is a fork/continuation of [ZeroNet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) project
(that has been abandoned by its creator) that is dedicated to sustaining existing p2p network and developing
its values of decentralization and freedom, while gradually switching to a better designed network

## Why fork?

During onion-v3 switch crisis, we needed a fork that worked with onion-v3 and didn't depend on trust to one or
two people. This fork started from fulfilling that mission, implementing minimal changes to
[ZeroNet/py3](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/tree/py3) branch which are easy to audit by anyone. While
you can still use the early releases of the fork to get onion-v3 working, the goal of this fork has since shifted
and we're dedicated to solving more problems and improving user experience and security all over, until the
brand new, completely transparent and audited network is ready and this project can be put to rest

## Why 0net?

* We believe in open, free, and uncensored networks and communication.
* No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is
  serving it.
* No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors.
* Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.
* Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is
  unavailable.


## Features
 * Real-time updated sites
 * Clone websites in one click
 * Password-less authorization using private/public keys
 * Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: allows easier dynamic site development
 * Anonymity: Tor network support with .onion hidden services (including onion-v3 support)
 * TLS encrypted connections (through clearnet)
 * Automatic uPnP port opening (if opted in)
 * Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support
 * Works with any modern browser/OS


## How does it work?

* After starting `zeronet.py` you will be able to visit zeronet sites using
  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address}` (eg.
  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/126NXcevn1AUehWFZLTBw7FrX1crEizQdr`).
* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent
  network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
* Each visited site is also served by you.
* Every site contains a `content.json` file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash
  and a signature generated using the site's private key.
* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the
  site, then he/she signs the new `content.json` and publishes it to the peers.
  Afterwards, the peers verify the `content.json` integrity (using the
  signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to
  other peers.

## How to join

### Install from your distribution repository

- NixOS: https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=22.05&show=zeronet-conservancy&type=packages&query=zeronet-conservancy (and see below)

### Install from Nix package manager (Linux or MacOS)

```
# install & configure nix package manager
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.zeronet-conservancy
```

or

`nix-env -iA nixos.zeronet-conservancy`

if you're on NixOS

(thanks @fgaz for making & maintaining the package)

### Install from source (recommended)

#### System dependencies

##### Generic unix-like (including mac os x)

Install autoconf and other basic development tools, python3 and pip.

##### Apt-based (debian, ubuntu, etc)
 - `sudo apt update`
 - `sudo apt install pkg-config python3-pip python3-venv python3-gevent`

##### Android/Termux
 - install [Termux](https://termux.com/) (in Termux you can install packages via `pkg install <package-names>`)
 - `pkg update`
 - `pkg install python automake git binutils` (TODO: check fresh installation whether there are more dependencies to install)
 - (optional) `pkg install tor`
 - (optional) run tor via `tor --ControlPort 9051 --CookieAuthentication 1` command (you can then open new session by swiping to the right)

#### Building python dependencies & running
 - clone this repo (NOTE: on Android/Termux you should clone it into "home" folder of Termux, because virtual environment cannot live in `storage/`)
 - `python3 -m venv venv` (make python virtual environment, the last `venv` is just a name, if you use different you should replace it in later commands)
 - `source venv/bin/activate` (activate environment)
 - `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (install dependencies)
 - `python3 zeronet.py` (**run zeronet-conservancy!**)
 - open the landing page in your browser by navigating to: http://127.0.0.1:43110/
 - to start it again from fresh terminal, you need to navigate to repo directory and:
 - `source venv/bin/activate`
 - `python3 zeronet.py`

#### Build Docker image
- build 0net image: `docker build -t 0net:conservancy . -f Dockerfile`
- or build 0net image with integrated tor: `docker build -t 0net:conservancy . -f Dockerfile.integrated_tor`
- and run it: `docker run --rm -it -v </path/to/0n/data/directory>:/app/data -p 43110:43110 -p 26552:26552 0net:conservancy`
- /path/to/0n/data/directory - directory, where all data will be saved, including your secret certificates. If you run it with production mode, do not remove this folder!
- or you can run it with docker-compose: `docker compose up -d 0net` up two containers - 0net and tor separately.
- or: `docker compose up -d 0net-tor` for run 0net and tor in one container.

#### alternative script
 - after installing general dependencies and cloning repo (as above), run `start-venv.sh` which will create a virtual env for you and install python requirements
 - more convenience scripts to be added soon

## Current limitations

* File transactions are not compressed
* No private sites
* No DHT support
* Centralized elements like zeroid (we're working on this!)
* No reliable spam protection (and on this too)
* Doesn't work directly from browser (one of the top priorities for mid-future)
* No data transparency


## How can I create a ZeroNet site?

 * Click on **⋮** > **"Create new, empty site"** menu item on the [admin page](http://127.0.0.1:43110/126NXcevn1AUehWFZLTBw7FrX1crEizQdr).
 * You will be **redirected** to a completely new site that is only modifiable by you!
 * You can find and modify your site's content in **data/[yoursiteaddress]** directory
 * After the modifications open your site, drag the topright "0" button to the left, then press **sign** and **publish** buttons on the bottom

We need more maintainers! Become one today! You don't need to know how to code,
there's a lot of other work to do.

### Fix bugs & add features

We've decided to go ahead and make a perfect p2p web, so we need more help

### Make your site/bring your content

We know the documentation is lacking, but we try our best to support anyone
who wants to migrate. Don't hesitate to ask.

### Use it and spread the word

Make sure to tell people why do you use 0net and this fork in particular! People
need to know their alternatives.
